SCRATCH NOTES
--> will end up deleting this file

* create a PHP for the Cloudways ../public_html/custom_cron_scripts/ folder (that should already be there!)
* add the PHP file
* move the files for this plugin from this repo's root to this subfolder


=================================================================================================================================================
I want to add a file that is "wget", or otherwise read, or perhaps an easy API call, to indicate if the wget updates to the files should happen
