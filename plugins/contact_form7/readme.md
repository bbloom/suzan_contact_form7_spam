I assume that:
- Akeeba is installed
- on Cloudways

Step 1: merge my custom mods with the original /includes/main.php
- merge them into mail_with_bobs_updates.php
- my mods are in mail_with_updates_for_reference_do_not_change.php
- when Contact Form7 updates, update this file
- get the Contact Form7 source from []()


update_contact_form7_with_bobs_updates.sh
